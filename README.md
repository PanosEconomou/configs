# Padots

These are some dotfiles for my local Hyprland installation

## To install

To install make sure you have cloned this repo in ``~/.config`` and once there do

```
cd ~/.config
pacman -S --needed - < pkglist.txt
```

This will install the necessary packages. I think then if you do ``reboot`` things will start working.
